# THE ELEMENTS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS

This repo tracks all of the work I've completed for the projects that are part
of the book [The Elements of Computing Systems 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Principles-dp-0262539802/dp/0262539802/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).

The best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and
this textbook leads learners through twelve chapters and projects that
gradually build the hardware platform and software hierarchy for a simple but
powerful computer system. In the process, learners gain hands-on knowledge of
hardware, architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers,
data structures and algorithms, and software engineering.

I am completing this book as part of my self-directed Masters in Machine
Learning to get a better grounding system level computer science. Below is a
summary of the topics covered in each project.
